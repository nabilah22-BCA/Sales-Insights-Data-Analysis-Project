Project Description
This project provides a detailed analysis of sales data for Atiq Hardware, a company supplying computer hardware and peripherals across India. The company is experiencing challenges in managing and analyzing sales data from its regional offices, which is hampering the ability of the sales director, Bhaven Patil, to gain reliable insights and make informed decisions.

The aim of this project is to consolidate, analyze, and visualize the sales data to provide actionable insights that can drive better decision-making and improve business performance.

Problem Statement
Atiq Hardware's sales data is inconsistent, fragmented across multiple regions, and difficult to analyze due to:

Reliance on verbal communication for sales insights.
Disorganized Excel reports from regional managers.
No clear visibility into regional performance or overall sales trends.
This project seeks to resolve these issues by centralizing the data and creating visual reports for easier understanding.

Objectives
Consolidate sales data from regional offices in a structured format.
Provide visual representations of sales trends, regional performance, and product sales.
Offer clear insights to support the company in making informed business decisions.
